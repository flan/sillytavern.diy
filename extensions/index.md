# Extensions

Within this section, you will find lists of community-created extensions for SillyTavern. On a desktop browser, they should be laid out in the panel to the left; on a mobile device, you may need to click the navigation button in the top-left.

Please note that extensions are added on a submission basis: we do not actively search the Internet to find extensions to index. [Submissions are always welcome, however.](/#contributing)

Our commitment is to ensure that any listed extensions are likely not abandoned, but we make no guarantee about quality, ease of use, or even whether they will achieve the desired outcome. This site is more akin to a knowledgebase with a security guard than a professionally managed repository of manuals.

By choosing to install any extensions listed here, you are accepting all risks and responsibilities associated with conducting necessary research, complexities associated with deployment, and maintenance that may be required in the future. Read project pages and user discussions, and look for signs of compatibility problems before proceeding.
