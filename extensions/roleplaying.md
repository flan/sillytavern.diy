# Roleplaying

Roleplaying extensions add new functionality to the storytelling capabilities of SillyTavern. They are typically highly dependent on the LLM used to structure responses and may require a considerable amount of upkeep and experimentation, but they add structure that may be incredibly desirable to people looking for a more game-like experience.

These will likely break often as stories progress and might cause significant frustration. Moreso than with any other type of extension, you will likely be on your own in terms of help if something is not working. Please do not ask the SillyTavern developers for assistance with any of these: there is literally nothing they can do.

## Extensions

- [WTracker](https://github.com/bmen25124/SillyTavern-WTracker)
  - Introduces structured metadata for complex scenes, such as character locations and equipment, allowing the LLM to construct more-tailored descriptions
    - Prone to degredation: you may need to adjust this data with some regularity in order to have it maintain structure and accuracy
  - Discord: https://discord.com/channels/1100685673633153084/1415737449782706299
