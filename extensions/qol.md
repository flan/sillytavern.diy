# Quality of Life

Quality of Life extensions focus on creating shortcuts or usability/accessibility enhancements that are a bit too specific in nature to be included in SillyTavern's core codebase. If an extension is primarily focused on customising the UI itself, rather than adding functionality to the engine, it's most likely a QoL extension.
