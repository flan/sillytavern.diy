# World Info

World Info extensions focus primarily on the management of Lorebooks and other means of conditionally injecting information into the prompt sent to an LLM when generating a response.

## Extensions

- [Memory Books](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/SillyTavern-MemoryBooks)
  - Semi-automatically generates lorebooks based on ranges of a chat, allowing "memories" to be cleanly partitioned and added to context in longer stories
    - Greatly reduces the amount of effort required to keep a story coherent; also has support for using lorebooks to guide the story through "Side Prompts"
    - Is not magic: requires a bit of setup and understanding on the user's part
  - Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/SillyTavernAI/comments/1nik127/st_memory_books/
