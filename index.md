# SillyTavern Resources

## What is this?

You've found a community-maintained repository of guides and resources intended to help with tailoring [SillyTavern](https://sillytavern.app/) to your specific use-case.

SillyTavern is a fantastic LLM Frontend for Power-Users, and [its documentation](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) covers every feature in great detail, but because it is a customisable platform for interacting with language-models, it needs to remain use-case agnostic: it is not a dedicated roleplaying system, nor is it only a way to quickly flip between system-prompts in conducting model research, even though it can easily be adapted to either or both goals.

This site, which is not affiliated with SillyTavern, is intended to bridge that gap in knowledge, between the technical and the practical, to help you get to where you want to go. It does not seek to replace the official documentation, and nothing found here will be supported by any official help-channels, but at least you'll get some idea of where to begin.

## What's hosted here?

[Guides](/guides/index.md) to customising SillyTavern and making it do things that are out-of-scope for the base system. From writing effective lorebooks to accessing your chats while away from home, if there's something SillyTavern-specific that you've wanted to do, there may be a guide for it in here.

[Lists of Extensions](/extensions/index.md) that have some popularity in the community. It can be hard to navigate through Discord channels and Reddit Threads to find everything that's available, so check here to see if there's something you should know about.

## Official Resources

This is a community-maintained site with no affiliation with the SillyTavern project.

[SillyTavern's official website is at **https://sillytavern.app/**](https://sillytavern.app/); if you are directed anywhere else, you may be installing an unsupported or maliciously altered fork, for which you will receive no help through official channels, so exercise caution.

## Contributing

If you want to submit a guide or update some other material on this site, please send a pull-request to [our Git respository](https://github.com/flan/sillytavern.diy).

If you have a more general suggestion, this site's maintainers can be found on the SillyTavern Discord server, linked from [the official SillyTavern site](https://sillytavern.app/). Please do not ask for help with any resources found on this site, however: nothing here is supported.
