# Guides

Within this section, you will find a collection of community-authored guides for SillyTavern. On a desktop browser, they should be laid out in the panel to the left; on a mobile device, you may need to click the navigation button in the top-left.

Please note that guides are added on a submission basis: we do not actively search the Internet to find guides to re-publish, since most information is not well-credited or may be published under non-permissive or ambiguous licensing terms, and we would like to respect the authors' decisions. [Submissions are always welcome, however.](/#contributing)

Our commitment is to screen any submitted guides to ensure they were written in good faith, but we make no guarantee about quality, ease of use, or even whether they will achieve the desired outcome. This site is more akin to a knowledgebase with a security guard than a professionally managed repository of manuals.

By choosing to follow any guides hosted here, you are accepting all risks and responsibilities associated with conducting necessary research, complexities associated with deployment, and maintenance that may be required in the future. Read any guide in full before beginning to make changes to your system and stop if you do not understand what it is telling you to do.
