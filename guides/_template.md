# Adding a guide

Guides occupy their own page and must be sorted in alphabetical order (which is the default if `order` is omitted from the Retype header) within an appropriate category.

To ensure that every guide is immediately useful to a prospective reader, they must start with a well-structured header, though what follows is entirely free-form.

## Criteria

For a guide to be considered, it must be free of anything that seems malicious in nature, like directing a user to do something dangerous or clearly unnecessary.

If it is required that the user download or access an external resource, it must point to a project-page or other official-seeming source. Direct links to zipfiles, executables, or the like will be rejected.

## Template

Guide headers must follow the following format:

```markdown
---
route: /guides/<category>/guide-name-slug

A brief summary of what this guide covers and what the user can expect upon completion.

```

If desired, author details may be placed in the footer of a guide, using the following format, though anonymity is completely acceptable.

If you are amending an existing guide, be respectful and place your information below that of any previous authors. If there was no prior authorship, prepend the following block:

```
## Credits

- Original guide submitted anonymously.
```

Like, just so it's obvious that you're not trying to take credit for someone else's work.

## Maintenance note

When creating a new guide category, name the markdown files and directories using Python's "snake_case" convention. If something is a work-in-progress and is not ready to make public, prefix it with an underscore, like `_template.md`.
